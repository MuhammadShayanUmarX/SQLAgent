"""
Advanced Analytics SQL Agent with Complex Query Capabilities

This script demonstrates an advanced implementation of a secure SQL agent designed for
complex business analytics and reporting. It builds upon the security framework from
script 03 while adding sophisticated business logic and analytics capabilities.

Key Features:
🔒 Same security guardrails as script 03 (read-only, validation, etc.)
📊 Advanced analytics queries (revenue analysis, customer segmentation, etc.)
📈 Business intelligence capabilities (trends, rankings, aggregations)
🔄 Multi-turn conversation support for iterative analysis
📋 Comprehensive business logic documentation in system prompt

Use Cases Demonstrated:
- Revenue analysis and reporting
- Customer lifetime value calculations
- Time-series analysis (weekly trends)
- Product performance rankings
- Multi-table joins and aggregations
- Iterative business intelligence queries

Educational Purpose: Shows how to build production-ready analytics agents that combine
security with sophisticated business intelligence capabilities.
